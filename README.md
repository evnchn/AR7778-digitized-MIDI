## Discovery

I bought a really cheap oscilloscope (~$HKD100) in hopes of measuring the calculator circuit and find the frequency of the clock crystal. 

However, the oscilloscope was made very poorly, and the long wire leads don't help. When the calculator is being probed, the CPU proceeds to run at a few Hz. 

Luckily, the audio engine keeps on going, allowing me to obtain extremely long samples. 

I was able to manually recreate the waveform by careful observation of the wave.
